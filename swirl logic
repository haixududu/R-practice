!= not equal the opposite of this !x == x negating expression 
question: This expression may be a little tricky, 
so think about negating the expression 5 == 7 (all you need is an exclamation point in front).
answer: !5 == 7
explaination: Let's take a moment to review. The equals operator `==` tests whether two
| boolean values or numbers are equal, the not equals operator `!=` tests
| whether two boolean values or numbers are unequal, and the NOT operator `!`
| negates logical expressions so that TRUE expressions become FALSE and FALSE
| expressions become TRUE.
more practice:  Which of the following evaluates to FALSE?
correct anwer:  !(0 >= -1)
more practice: What do you think the following expression will evaluate to?: (TRUE != FALSE)
| == !(6 == 7)
answer:TRUE
